      <p>The "Submarine Immersive Experience" is a fun underwater game where players, as divers,
         click on floating bubbles to catch them and score points. The game takes place in a 
         beautiful ocean filled with fish, corals, and treasures. Players can move around and 
         explore the underwater world, while bubbles float by. When clicked, the bubbles pop with
          a cool animation. The goal is to catch as many bubbles as possible!</p>
